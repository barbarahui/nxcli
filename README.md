quick utility to upload files to Nuxeo

```
nx --help
nx upfile --help
```

In the future, there may be added more `nx` commands; such as

 * `nx updir` recursivly upload directory
 * `nx mkdir --type Folderish ...`
 
But right now, just uploads files into pre-existing folders

needs a better package name

## notes on node

`npm link .` is very helpful during development
`npm install https://github.com/tingletech/nx/archive/master.tar.gz`
